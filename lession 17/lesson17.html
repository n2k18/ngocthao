    </b>ImageReady automatically assigns one of the following states to new 
    rollovers you create.<br>
    <b>Over</b> Activates the image when the user rolls over the slice or 
    image-map area with the mouse while the mouse button is not pressed.<br>
    <b>Down</b> Activates the image when the user presses the mouse button on 
    the slice or image-map area. The state appears as long as the viewer keeps 
    the mouse button pressed down on the area.<br>
    <b>Click</b> Activates the image when the user clicks the mouse on the slice 
    or image-map area. The state appears until the user moves the mouse out of 
    the rollover area.<br>
    Note: Different Web browsers, or different versions of a browser, may 
    process clicks and double-clicks differently.<br>
    <b>Custom</b> Activates the image of the specified name when the user 
    performs the action defined in the corresponding JavaScript code. (You must 
    create JavaScript code and add it to the HTML file for the Web page in order 
    for the Custom rollover option to function. See a JavaScript manual for more 
    information.)<br>
    <b>None</b> Preserves the current state of the image for later use, but does 
    not output an image when the file is saved as a Web page.<br>
    <b>Selected</b> Activates the rollover state when the user clicks the mouse 
    on the slice or image-map area. The state appears until the viewer activates 
    another selected rollover state, and other rollover effects can occur while 
    the selected state is active.<br>
    <b>Out</b> Activates the image when the user rolls the mouse out of the 
    slice or image-map area. (The Normal state usually serves this purpose.)<br>
    <b>Up</b> Activates the image when the user releases the mouse button over 
    the slice or image-map area.</font></td>

    <font face="Arial">If you’ve already completed other lessons in this book, 
    it’s likely that you’ve had experience defining workspaces. ImageReady has 
    several predefined workspaces that you can use for specific kinds of work, 
    and you could certainly use one of those as a starting<br>
    place for this lesson. But you can also create a specialized refinement of a 
    predefined workspace and save it as a custom workspace, which is what you’ll 
    do now.</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">Start Adobe ImageReady. If the palettes are not in 
      the default locations, choose Window &gt; Workspace &gt; Default Palette 
      Locations.</font></li>

      the Info palette, at the top of the work area.</font></li>

    <font face="Arial">One of the fun things ImageReady can do with text is to 
    warp the font shape. For example, you can make the words appear as they 
    might look if they were painted on a three-dimensional object.<br>
    You’ll combine that applied warping with a rollover state. As a result, the 
    warped text will appear on the final HTML image only in response to specific 
    user actions.</font></p>

      display the text options in the tool options bar, and click the Create 
      Warped Text button .<br>
      Note: You do not need to use the Type tool or select the text. The warping 
      effect always applies to the entire text layer, not individual words or 
      characters.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Select Fisheye in the Style pop-up menu, and drag 
      the Bend slider to 30%. Leave the Vertical and Horizontal Distortion 
      sliders at 0%, and click OK. Notice the distortion of the Museo Arte text.</font></li>

    you can test the interactive behaviors of your slices in ImageReady. You do 
    this by stepping out of working mode into preview mode. While you are 
    previewing, some palettes, such as the Layers palette, are dimmed because 
    you cannot select layers or make adjustments in those palettes in preview 
    mode.</font></p>

    and focus on the next item in the palette that requires your attention. In 
    this lesson, we’ll frequently remind you to collapse grouped items when you

    In this design, the original version of the central image was fully colored 
    instead of the heavily blue-toned version that you see in Normal state. 
    Sections of the original version have been copied onto layers in this file, 
    above the blue-version Background layer. The<br>
    original-color sections line up perfectly with the blue image, so making

    <font face="Arial">A remote rollover is the association of one slice with 
    another one so that an action in one slice affects the visibility or effects 
    in the other slice.<br>
    For remote slices, it is not enough to change the visibility settings in the 
    Layers palette for the remote slice. You must also create the relationship 
    between the two slices. Fortunately, the pickwick&nbsp; feature makes it 
    easy and intuitive to accomplish this part.</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">In the Web Content palette, do the following:<br>
      • In the Menu Slices table, expand the Exhibits and Members slices so that 
      you can see the Over and Click rollover states nested under each of those 
      slices.<br>
      • Select the Click rollover state for the Exhibits slice.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">In the Layers palette, select the Exhibit_info 
      layer and click the visibility box to set an eye icon&nbsp; for that 
      layer.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">In the Web Content palette, drag the pickwick&nbsp; 
      from the Click rollover state of the Exhibits slice to the Exhibit_info 
      layer in the image window, so that the slice boundary is highlighted by a 
      dark border.<br>
      When you release the mouse button, notice the new badge&nbsp; in the 
      symbol sets for the Exhibits slice in the image window and Web Content 
      palette. Also notice the badge next to the Exhibit Info slice.<br>
      Note: Instead of dragging the pickwick to the target slice in the image 
      window, you can drag it to that slice in the Web Content palette. The 
      result is the same with either method.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Select Normal in the Web Content palette, and click 
      the arrow on the Exhibits slice to collapse the rollovers nested below it.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Select the Click rollover state for the Members 
      slice.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Repeat Steps 2–4 but use the Members Info slice as 
      the target for the remote rollover:<br>
      Make that layer visible and then drag the pickwick from the Click state to 
      the “Members Discount” image. Be careful to select Normal at the end of 
      the process.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">In the Layers palette, click the arrow to collapse 
      the Info Panels layer set.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">If you accidentally release the pickwick at the wrong 
    slice or decide later that you don’t want to use the remote rollover at all, 
    you can remove it. To do this, select the rollover state you want to edit, 
    such as an Over or Down state nested under the triggering layer. Then find 
    the Remote badge&nbsp; between the eye icon and the name of the target slice 
    in the Web Content palette. Click that Remote badge to delete it, which 
    removes the remote rollover relationship.</font></td>

    <p><b><font face="Arial">Review Answers</font></b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">Normal and Over are probably the two most common 
      rollover states. Normal is the default appearance of the Web page, as it 
      opens and before the user performs any mouse actions. Over is the state 
      when the pointer tip is within the defined area but without the user 
      pressing the mouse button in any way. There are a total of eight different 
      rollover states you can create in ImageReady, if you count Custom and 
      None. However, since you can create your own Custom states, there are 
      innumerable other possibilities.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">A slice can have multiple rollover states, but only 
      one of each type. For example, a slice could not have two different Over 
      states, but one Over state could trigger multiple changes in the slice and 
      also in one or more remote slices. Because these different states<br>
      are associated with different mouse actions, there is no conflict and no 
      reason why they cannot coexist.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Yes, certainly! You can make the same kinds of 
      changes in layer visibility, position, or effects that you can make with 
      slices, just as you can link both slices and image maps to URLs.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">A remote rollover is when a mouse action taking 
      place in one slice affects the appearance of another slice in the image. 
      These have sometimes been called secondary rollovers.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Yes. Properly set up, you can use remote rollovers 
      to do other things, such as launch an application or run an animation. For 
      more information, see ImageReady Help.</font></li>
