    <font face="Arial">Before you start working on the file, you’ll define a new workspace 
    especially for
    animation work. Having the right workspace available at any time reduces 
    screen clutter
    and makes your task more efficient and more enjoyable.<br>
    ImageReady offers a predefined Interactivity Palette Locations workspace, 
    which you’re
    already familiar with if you’ve done the previous ImageReady lessons. Since 
    the interactivity
    in this lesson is limited to animating, you can reduce the number of open 
    palettes
    even further, starting from the default workspace configuration.</font></p>

    can make an
    animated character alternate between different expressions or make an object 
    move back

    The Dolphin.psd image file includes five layers, as you can see by examining

    <td><font face="Arial"><b>For the Web: Tweening frames<br>
    </b>You use the Tween command to automatically add or modify a series of frames 
    between two existing
    frames—varying the layer attributes (position, opacity, or effect 
    parameters) evenly between the new frames
    to create the appearance of movement. For example, if you want to fade out a 
    layer, set the opacity of the layer
    in the starting frame to 100%; then set the opacity of the same layer in the 
    ending frame to 0%. When you
    tween between the two frames, the opacity of the layer is reduced evenly 
    across the new frames.<br>
    The term “tweening” is derived from “in betweening,” the traditional 
    animation term used to describe
    this process. Tweening significantly reduces the time required to create 
    animation effects such as fading
    in or fading out, or moving an element across a frame. You can edit tweened 
    frames individually after you
    create them.<br>
    If you select a single frame, you choose whether to tween the frame with the 
    previous frame or the next frame.<br>
    If you select two contiguous frames, new frames are added between the 
    frames. If you select more than two
    frames, existing frames between the first and last selected frames are 
    altered by the tweening operation. If you
    select the first and last frames in an animation, these frames are treated 
    as contiguous, and tweened frames
    are added after the last frame. (This tweening method is useful when the 
    animation is set to loop multiple
    times.)<br>
    Note: You cannot select discontiguous frames for tweening.</font></td>

      <li><font face="Arial">A simple way to create animation is to start with a 
      layered Photoshop file. Use the Duplicate Current Frame button in the 
      Animation palette to create a new frame, and then use the Layers palette 
      to alter the position, opacity, or effects of one of the selected frames.<br>
      Then, create intermediate frames between the selection and the new frame 
      either manually, by using the Duplicate Current Frame button, or 
      automatically, by using the Tween command.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">You can instruct Adobe ImageReady to tween 
      intermediate frames between any two adjacent frames. Tweening can change 
      layer opacity or position between two frames, or to add new layers to a 
      sequence of frames. You cannot tween discontiguous frames.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Click the Show Options button in the Optimize 
      palette, and then choose File &gt; Save Optimized to optimize animations. 
      Choose Optimize Animation from the Animation palette menu to perform 
      optimization tasks specific to animation files, including removing 
      redundant pixels and cropping frames according to the bounding box.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">When you optimize GIF files, ImageReady also 
      generates an adaptive, perceptual, or selective palette for the file, 
      based on all frames in the animation. ImageReady applies a special 
      dithering technique to ensure that dither patterns are consistent across 
      all frames, to prevent flickering during playback. The application also 
      optimizes frames so that only areas that change from frame to frame are 
      included, greatly reducing the file size of the animated GIF.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">A frame-disposal method specifies whether to 
      discard the selected frame before displaying the next frame when an 
      animation includes background transparency. This option determines whether 
      the selected frame will appear through the transparent areas of the next 
      frame. Generally, the Automatic option is suitable for most animations. 
      This option selects a disposal method based on the presence or absence of 
      transparency in the next frame, and discards the selected frame if the 
      next frame contains layer transparency.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">To edit an existing animation frame, you first 
      select the frame, either by clicking the frame thumbnail in the Animation 
      palette or by navigating to the desired frame using the First Frame, 
      Select Previous Frame, or Select Next Frame buttons in the Animation 
      palette or Layers palette. Then, edit the layers in the image to update 
      the contents of the selected frame.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Files for animations must be saved in GIF format or 
      as a QuickTime movie. You cannot create animations as JPEG or PNG files.</font></li>
